## How to use the dataset
This dataset presents a great opportunity to actively analyze customer spending habits on products and services to improve sales performance. The data contains information about the date of purchase, year, month, customer age, gender, country, state and product category. Further analysis can reveal insights into different customer segments based on their demographic characteristics such as age and gender as well as location (country & state).

The dataset also includes 3 additional columns at the end: quantity purchased in each transaction, unit cost and unit price for each product or service purchased which can be used to determine if customers are purchasing items in bulk or buying more expensive items than usual. Likewise any discrepancies between the unit cost & price can help establish whether discounts were applied during those transactions which could potentially point towards loyalty or reward programs being put in place for returning customers. Lastly the final column shows total revenue generated from those purchases which we can use to identify any patterns whereby certain groups of customers show higher purchasing power than others based on their spends (unit cost & quantity combination) over various periods/months/years of sales interactions with them.

In summary this dataset allows us to explore numerous dimensions related to ascertaining superior sales performance by studying how its various attributes play out together when it comes down to driving profitability through improved customer acquisition strategies as well increasing purchase rates from existing ones minus any discounts available in-between!
